## What this adds

<!-- One line: "A theme called …", "A skill that …", "Canva's MCP server". -->

## Checklist

- [ ] `node check.mjs` passes and `index.json` / `apps.json` are updated.
- [ ] I made this, or its license lets it be shared here (looks CC0 or CC BY, skills MIT or Apache 2.0, apps CC0).

### For an app (`apps/<id>/`)

- [ ] The URL is the vendor's **own** hosted MCP server, on their domain, and their docs list it: <!-- link to the vendor's docs -->
- [ ] I connected it and listed its tools. Sign-in asks only for what its capabilities need.
- [ ] `capabilities` say what a bot can do with it, nothing it can't.
- [ ] `logo.svg` (optional) is the vendor's single-color mark, for example from Simple Icons, with no scripts, styles or links.

### For a starter bot, routine idea or plugin

- [ ] A starter bot's persona says what it does and asks before acting; its routines run at sensible times.
- [ ] A plugin's `commit` is the full commit I read, and `adds` lists everything it installs (skills, servers, secrets it asks for).

Community or self-hosted servers don't belong here: anyone can already add them in Casama with Settings → Connections → Custom server.
